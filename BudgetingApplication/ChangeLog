0.0.3
  NEW
    - Added CHANGELOG.txt to map out changes
    MAIN
    	- Added versioning line to list out application name and version
    BUDGET
    	- lists out current budgets or notes that there are no budgets prior
    	  to inputting.
    INCOME
    	- thought up logic for other forms of income
    	- did a basic set up for inputting multiple incomes
  CHANGES
  	- Refactored EXPENSES to BUDGET due to implementation more like setting 
  	  thresholds
  	- minor consistancy changes
  	  - set up so that MAIN runs functions from each class so all is centralized
  	  - changed some wording and formatting to make it a little more 
  	    user friendly
  	BUDGET <- EXPENSES
    	- changed variable names
    	- Allow for input of decimal percentages
    STATISTICS
    	- got rid of useless variables for now since the plan is to calculate
    	  without inputting values into stats, but directly from other classes
    	- STATISTICS is now planned to be the central hub to print out 
    	  calculations
    MAIN
    	- set up precaution to running stats without any budgeting (for now
    	  since stats only has calculate by budgets given);
  TODO
    - create a format for (TEXTFile/CSV) for loading and saving
    - create logic to parse SAVEFILE when loading
    - create logic to save SAVEFILE (on exit? or changing between "HUBs")
    - create console for this project to have the console clear each time 
      choices are available.
